# Cloud-Computing-Project

This project involved designing, implementing, and evaluating a web application that performs sentiment analysis on tweets related to a given topic and sends the analysis results via email. The entire process is documented and explained in the accompanying [Report](https://github.com/SimoneChieppa/Cloud-Computing-Project/blob/main/Cloud_Computing.pdf). The focus was on assessing the application's performance, scalability, and design considerations. The Report provides detailed insights into the project's execution and the utilization of cloud computing technologies.
